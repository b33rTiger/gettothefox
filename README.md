# Get to The Fox!!

This is the first app I created at the beginning of my web dev bootcamp. I plan to add some animations and other stuff when time permits.

The object of the game is to go 7 blocks and get to The Fox. You start with 20 energy points. Each turn you move one block. Each block requires you to eat and drink something that will either increase or decrease your energy. Good luck!!

In the meantime, if you would like to check it out, download all the files/folders and open index.html. No need to install anything.
