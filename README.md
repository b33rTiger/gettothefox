# Object Oriented Javascript

## Moving on to classes

###Description
In pairs, you will model, plan, design, build tests for, and then finally begin creating an object oriented text-based game. This game can be whatever type you would like, get creative.

There have been several resources left for you to browse through with different examples of text based games. Use them if you feel lost. Remember, your game isn't expected to be huge, so start out with an MVP (minimum viable product), or in this case a small demo. Build from there if you have time.

Feel free to review [codecademy's code your own adventure](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-x9DnD/0/1?curriculum_id=506324b3a7dffd00020bf661) JS tutorial. Think about how your game will work.

Since choose your own adventure games are extremely simple, try to avoid making one unless you add in some extra functionality.
